 <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
 <p>DigiCard was born out of a need to be able to keep shopping and activities involving money very simple and easy. DigiCard will be a universal card that can work with any ATM or bank without occurring additional fees for taking out money from a bank or ATM that does not match the card. DigiCard also allows you to check your balance from anywhere on the go without having to stop at an ATM or bank by using a digital interface that is activated directly from the card itself with one simple press. Going to banks to do activities like these is time-consuming and complicated so the goal with DigiCard is to simplify these activities and make it so people can focus more on shopping or managing money or bills or whatever the consumer wants to do with their money. Itâ€™s to help make banking and managing money, simple, easy and convenient and as a bonus, it can access the internet and digital storefronts with a few short digital swipes.</p>
