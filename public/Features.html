	<h2>DigiCard Features</h2>

<hr/>
	<h3>Physical Features</h3>

	<p>DigiCard is made out of glass so it can be touch screen like any other smart device. It is basically treated like any other credit card, except that it is the “mother of all credit cards.” Don't worry! Just because DigiCard is a smart device doesn't mean that it cannot fit into your wallet. </p>

 <h4>ATM Use</h4>
 <p>DigiCard can be used on any ATM or bank without paying extra fees for taking out money from a bank or ATM that does not match the card. This saves you a lot of time and money by not having to go to a certain bank or ATM. Who knows? You can even go to the bank right by your house.</p>

 <h4>Bank Compatibility</h4>
 <p>Since it is a universal credit card, DigiCard can be used with any bank you choose, from Chase to Bank of America to TD Bank to several international banks. You name it! In addition, you do not have to pay extra fees if you use your DigiCard with a bank that you're not part of.</p>
